Objectives: a) Indefinite loops, b) Summing and counting, c) Named constant, d) data types int, double, String. This program works like a Self-service Cash Register. A customer may purchase a number of items, some are taxable, and some are not. The customer operating the register inputs a price of 0.00 to end the sentinel controlled loop. For each item, the operator answers a yes/no question to indicate if the item is taxable. The yes/no question is to be answered by just typing a single letter (y or n) or the words yes or no. The user may type this response in upper or lower case. The program maintains two accumulator (summing) variables, one to add up the prices for all taxable items and one to add up the prices of non-taxable items. Once the data input loop is over, the program calculates the tax due on the total price of taxable items. The tax rate is to be defined as a named constant with value 0.0725 (7.25%). Since the result from the tax computation may result in a number with more than 2 decimal digits, this result should be rounded to the nearest penny (2 digits after decimal point). See later for the code of a function (method) that you may use for this purpose. Other double values calculated may also have round-off errors, so they should also be rounded to 2 decimal digits. The program displays a summary of all the purchased items (see the sample output).
